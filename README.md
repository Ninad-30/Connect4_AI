# IE616 Game Theory Project

In this Project we explore the game of Connect 4 and a variation of it. 
Key Structure of the Report:
- What is Connect 4
- On the game tree
- Analysis of the classic game
- Minimax Algorithm and its implementation
- Game Environment in python
- The Variation
- Observaations playing against the algorithm

### Dependencies:
- Python libraries - numpy, pygame. If not present, install them using "pip install numpy" or "pip install pygame" run in the terminal

### How to Play the game with the Variation:
- To play a move, i.e. place a piece, hover the mouse curser near the intended column to be played, and click on the primary mouse button (left-click on most)
- To the play variation, press a number from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} from the number row on top on a standard keyboard. Column indexing starts from 0, so the left most column on the board is represented by 0 and 1 is to its right, and so on. 
- As soon as a player wins, game will end and text will appear suggesting who won.
